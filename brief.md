#CODE CHALLENGE  
    
##User story:     
As a user, I want to be able to see the minimum, maximum, average temperature, and humidity for a given city and period of time.      
      
##Requirements:     
RESTful API to serve weather data (ideally Django)      
Fetch weather data from any API, e.g. http://openweathermap.org/api     
Front end to display the requested data (ideally React)     
Include a table showing results     
Include a bar chart of results      
Components must be responsive and work on restricted screen sizes     
Use git for version control and publish on GitHub     
Unit tests      
      
#Extra goals:      
Allow the user to input a location from the UI      
Allow the user to input a time period from the UI     
Deploy it somewhere publicly available      
Make the component easy to embed into other projects
